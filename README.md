### Just a heads up: Charts 5.0 has some breaking changes. Charts has now been renamed DGCharts to prevent conflicts with Apple's new Swift Charts. Please read [the release/migration notes](https://github.com/danielgindi/Charts/releases/tag/5.0.0).

### One more heads up: As Swift evolves, if you are not using the latest Swift compiler, you shouldn't check out the master branch. Instead, you should go to the release page and pick up whatever suits you.
